  "content": "The **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.\n\nDeveloped by J. Welles Wilder, the RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, the RSI is considered:\n\n* **Overbought** when above 70\n* **Oversold** when below 30\n\nThese levels can signal a potential for a trend reversal or a pullback. However, it's crucial to use RSI in conjunction with other indicators and the overall market context."
